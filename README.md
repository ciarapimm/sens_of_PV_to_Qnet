# sens_of_PV_to_Qnet
This folder contatins videos which show time evolving adjoint sensitivities associated with Chapter 2 and 4 of the thesis: Southern Ocean Ventilation: Connection to dynamic tracers and heat uptake by Ciara Pimm.

Chapter 2 - videos of the sensitivities of large-scale PV to net heat flux (qnet) in the south Indian Ocean (Section 2.4.1) and south east Pacific Ocean (Section 2.6.1) mode water foramtion regions. sens_of_PV_to_qnet_SI(Converted) contains the video for the south Indian mode water formation region, and sens_of_PV_to_Qnet_SE(Converted) contains the video for the south east Pacific mode wate formation region. 

Chapter 4 - videos of the sensitivities of volume to net heat flux (qnet) in the central and eastern pools (Section 4.2.6) of the south Pacific Ocean mode water foramtion regions. CENTRAL_dVol_dQnet(Converted) contains the video for the central mode water formation pool, and EASTERN_dVol_dQnet(Converted) contains the video for the eastern mode water formation pool.
